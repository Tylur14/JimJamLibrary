# JimJamLibrary
 The library for various Jim Jam scripts and includes the Library Core!

# Installation for Library
 To install simply drag the JimJam_Library.cs file into your Unity project. Then you can open the Library window from the top tool bar: JimJam>Library

# How to use
 This tool has two purposes, to have a single layer of one-click version control & to easily share reusable scripts across multiple projects.
 
 To get started find a file you want to add to your Library, right click, then click 'JJL - Send to Library'. If you don't have the required directory it will automatically create it for you. From there you can take better advantage of the features this tool offers!
 
 Once you have a file in the Library you can click 'Check for Updates' in the Library window to display all files in your Library. You can also click 'Open Directory' to open an explorer at the Library directory.

 Also each file has status indicators. It will check if the resource in the Library is newer than the one in your project, if your project file is newer than the resource, if they're the same, and if you simply don't have the file in your project.
